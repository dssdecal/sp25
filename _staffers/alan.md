bio: ALO! I’m Alan, a senior studying EECS. I spawned at Irvine, CA and this will be my second sem as a part of Acadev. Apparently I’m weird for mixing my neapolitan ice cream but I still stand by it. I enjoy playing tennis, pickleball, badminton, smash, climbing, hiking, and consuming copious amounts of animanga. Also, I’ll pay anyone $20 if they can beat my zetamac score or $5 if you can beat me in word hunt.
