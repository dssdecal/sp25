bio: Hi I’m Manav! I’m a sophomore studying Cognitive Science and I'm really excited to be a part of the academic development committee this semester! Some of my interests include listening to music (i love sonder, giveon, uzi, and i’m a BIG tory lanez fan), playing/watching sports (baseball, basketball, football, and even fantasy football), yapping, eating a lot of food, and trying to learn how to play my ukelele (emphasis on trying). I can't wait to meet everyone this fall!
