bio: Hi! I'm Alex, a first year Data Science major from San Francisco. I took the DeCal last semester and had a great experience, so I am super excited to be returning as a tutor to help you all enjoy it as much as I did! I love playing tennis, hiking, skiing, baking, watching sports, and trying new foods!
